## Action Classification Experiment on MSRAction3D

This folder contains files for action recognition experiment on MSRAction3D dataset.

## Data Processing

Download raw MSRAction3D dataset from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1djwAK3oZTAIFbCz531eClxINmsZgGO_H/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (~62MB). Extract the `.zip` file to get `Depth.rar` file and extract it in `Depth` directory. Then in this directory, run the following command to preprocess the data. `--num_cpu` flag is used to specify the number of CPUs to use during parallel processing.

```
python preprocess_file.py --input_dir /path/to/Depth --output_dir processed_data --num_cpu 11
```

## Training

The script for training and testing the model is `command_train.sh`. To train, use the following command.

```
sh command_train.sh
```

One may change the flags such as `num_frame`, `num_point` etc for different architecture specs.
